<p>My name is Benito but you can call me Benny. I work in quality control for the food industry . I've been interested in tech since my first Atari. I've always wanted to learn how to create Artificial Intelligence and as of October 2019, I decided to make that dream into a career thanks to Career Karma , who introduced to community of like-minded individuals and got me on my towards reaching my " dream". I completed my 21day Ck challenge and while in that process, met with ash from Flatiron school , who was very clear informative in our initial meeting . I was accepted into school and since 12/9/2019 , I am officially attending  and working on their curriculum.  I will be writing  about the layers of my dream and how it became a reality.</p>
