  "  Ever since I was a child , I'd been interested in how things worked . What types of things? All types of things!
		
		For example, a leaf from a tree. I was seen as the little kid holding a leaf to my eyes outside in the sun . But what I saw was this:

		I see the differnet shades of green, the veins , all the shapes that go into making a leaf, where it grew out from , the glitter-like shine that they get in the morning etc. Also, my love for gaming. There are charachters and scenes , all created from someones mind. I knew these people knew how things work, function, tick. I wanted that.  My curiosity went from wondering how things functioned to wanting to create them and make them work for me . Artificial Intelligence amazes me ! I want to create, to be a creator and to bring to life my ideas and dreams.  This is my main reason for wanting to be a software engineer.
